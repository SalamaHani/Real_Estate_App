        </h2>
        <p className="mt-1 text-lg text-start italic text-neutral-400">
          The Home Valuation Report gives you an in-depth comparison to similar
          properties so that you can understand market trends. You will gain
          insights into current market trends in your area by seeing how your
          home compares to similar properties, including beds, baths, square
          footage, parking, difference between list and sale price, and more.
          This can be valuable if you are considering selling your home,
          refinancing, or making improvements.
